    "Inheritance lets one class reuse and customize another class’s code, and these questions are all about how and when to use that effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## How inheritance promotes code reuse\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a **child class (subclass)** to automatically get attributes and methods from a **parent class (base/superclass)** without copying code.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common behavior (like `move()`, `save()`, `render()`) is written once in the base class.\n",
    "- Subclasses inherit that behavior and only implement what’s different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example idea (no code, just concept):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Animal` defines: `eat()`, `sleep()`.\n",
    "- `Dog` and `Cat` inherit `Animal`.\n",
    "- You don’t rewrite `eat()` and `sleep()` for every animal; they are reused via inheritance.[2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces duplication and supports the DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself).[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## When you would override an inherited method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overriding** means: a subclass provides its own version of a method that exists in the parent class.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "You do this when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The general behavior in the base class is *almost* right but needs to be specialized.\n",
    "- Conceptually, the method is the same action, but done differently for the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Animal.make_sound()` is a generic method.\n",
    "  - `Dog.make_sound()` overrides it to “bark”.\n",
    "  - `Cat.make_sound()` overrides it to “meow”.\n",
    "- `Shape.area()` defined as an abstract/general idea.\n",
    "  - `Circle.area()` overrides to use radius.\n",
    "  - `Rectangle.area()` overrides to use width × height.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you reuse the **interface** (same method name) but customize the **implementation** in the subclass.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## What causes diamond inheritance problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The **diamond problem** happens in **multiple inheritance** when a class inherits from two classes that share a common base class, creating a diamond-shaped hierarchy:[4][5]\n",
    "\n",
    "- `A` is the top base class.\n",
    "- `B` and `C` both inherit from `A`.\n",
    "- `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "    A\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  B   C\n",
    "   \\ /\n",
    "    D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem: if `A` defines a method (say `method()`), and `D` doesn’t override it, there are **two paths** to `A.method()` (via `B` and via `C`), which creates ambiguity:[6][5][4]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which version should `D` “see” or call?\n",
    "- Some languages disallow this; others (like Python) use a specific **method resolution order (MRO)** to decide a consistent order and avoid calling the same base twice.[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "The core issue: **ambiguity and duplicate inheritance** of the same base in a multiple-inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use cases for private name mangling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name mangling** in Python happens for attributes starting with **two leading underscores**, e.g. `__value`. Python rewrites the name internally to `_ClassName__value`.[8][9]\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not real security; it’s mainly for **avoiding accidental name conflicts**, especially in inheritance:[9]\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you write a base class that may be subclassed by others.\n",
    "- You have an internal attribute or method that:\n",
    "  - Should not be overridden accidentally by subclasses.\n",
    "  - Is meant to be “internal implementation detail”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Framework / library code:\n",
    "  - Base class uses `__internal_state` so subclasses are less likely to accidentally clash with that name.[10][9]\n",
    "- Avoiding collisions:\n",
    "  - Base class has `__started` for some time-tracking logic.\n",
    "  - Subclass wants its own `started` attribute.\n",
    "  - Name mangling keeps them separate (`_Base__started` vs `SubClass.started`).[10][8]\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: name mangling is useful when **designing classes meant to be extended** and wanting to protect internal details from accidental override or conflict.[9]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## How you might utilize inheritance in your own programs\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical way to use inheritance is to identify **common behavior** and **differences** among related concepts, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Put the shared behavior in a base class.\n",
    "2. Put the specific behavior in subclasses.\n",
    "3. Optionally override methods where behavior differs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenarios (conceptual):\n",
    "\n",
    "- GUI elements:\n",
    "  - Base class `Widget` with `draw()`, `move()`.\n",
    "  - Subclasses `Button`, `Label`, `TextBox` override `draw()` for their own appearance.\n",
    "- Game entities:\n",
    "  - Base `Character` with `health`, `move()`, `take_damage()`.\n",
    "  - `Player`, `Enemy`, `NPC` extend and customize things like AI behavior or control.\n",
    "- Data models:\n",
    "  - Base `Model` with methods to `save()`, `delete()`, `validate()`.\n",
    "  - Concrete subclasses `User`, `Order`, `Product` inherit persistence logic and override validation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your case, since you’re learning Python basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You could start with a base class like `Animal` or `Vehicle` and create specific subclasses.\n",
    "- Practice:\n",
    "  - Inheriting attributes/methods.\n",
    "  - Overriding one or two methods.\n",
    "  - Possibly using a “private” mangled attribute in the base class to protect internal state if you plan to extend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you describe a small project idea (e.g., “I want to build a to-do app” or “a simple game”), an inheritance plan can be sketched specifically for that.\n",
